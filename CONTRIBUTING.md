# Contributing rules

- Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).
- Enable `pre-commit` hooks in the repository folder: `pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`. These hooks automatically format the code and check the format of the commit message.
- The format of commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.
